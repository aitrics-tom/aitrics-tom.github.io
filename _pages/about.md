## About Me

I'm a creative developer and designer passionate about building beautiful and functional digital experiences. My work sits at the intersection of technology and art, where I explore new possibilities through code and design.

### What I Do

- **Web Development**: Building interactive web experiences with modern technologies
- **Design**: Creating user-centered, intuitive interfaces
- **Creative Coding**: Exploring artistic expression through programming

### Current Focus

I'm currently exploring the intersection of AI and creativity, particularly interested in generative AI tools and interface design. I believe in the power of technology to enhance human creativity rather than replace it.

### Experience

With a background in both computer science and design, I bring a unique perspective to every project. I've worked on various projects ranging from web applications to interactive installations, always focusing on creating meaningful user experiences.
